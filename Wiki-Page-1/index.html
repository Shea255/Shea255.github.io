    <b><header>    Crown Shyness</header></b>
    <p>Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement, canopy shyness, shyness, or 
        inter-crown spacing spacingl3]) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
        in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a 
        canopy with channel-like gaps. 45 The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees 
        of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. 61
        [7 There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior,and 
        research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae. 8]
