        <h3>HOW TO MAKE STRAWBERRY LEMONADE</h3>
        <p>
            There are basically 3 parts to making this delicious drink and they are all really simple! 
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Squeeze your lemons! It’s a very tedious process but the reward is worth it. 
            We will need about 1 cup of fresh lemon juice which requires about 8 large lemons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the strawberry juice! All you need is strawberries and water. To pick ripe
            strawberries, look for those that are a deep red with no white spots. They will be 
            plump and shouldn’t be too firm or too soft. If you want lemonade on the sweeter 
            side, you can add a little sugar to the strawberry juice as well. Add the strawberries 
            and water to a food processor until there are no more chunks and it resembles juice. 
            Then strain out all the seeds with a fine sieve and it is good to go.

        </li>
        <li>
            Sweeten it up with a simple syrup. This part is super easy because instead of making it
            on the stove, we can make it in the microwave in 2 minutes. Just add the sugar to 
            some hot water and microwave in 30 second intervals until the syrup is clear and all the sugar is dissolved. Mix after each interval with a 
            spoon. If you don’t have a microwave, you can still do this over the stove. Just allow the syrup to chill after either way to room temperature.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Once all three parts above are done, you just mix it all together with more water and that’s it! 
        Super refreshing with some ice on a hot summer day

        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <h3>SIMPLE SYRUP</h3>
        <li>
            1 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 1/4 cup hot water
        </li>
        <h3>STRAWBERRY JUICE</h3>
        <li>
            10 ounces strawberries 
        </li>

        <li>
            1 cup water
        </li>
        
        <h3>
            LEMON JUICE

        </h3>

        <li>
            1 cup lemon juice about 8 large lemons
        </li>

        <li>
            4 cups water
        </li>

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h3>TO MAKE THE SIMPLE SYRUP</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a microwave-safe bowl, add hot water along with the sugar.
            </li>

            <li>
                Microwave for 30 seconds. Take it out and mix. Microwave for another 30 
                seconds. Take it out and mix again. If it is clear and all the sugar is dissolved,
                it's done. If you still see sugar, microwave for another 30 seconds. Once clear,
                pop in the fridge to cool down to room temperature.
            </li>

            <h3>TO MAKE THE STRAWBERRY JUICE</h3>
            <li>
                To a food processor, add the strawberries and water. Blend until there is no
                more chunks and completely smooth like a juice.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place a fine sieve over a bowl and strain the juice to remove the seeds. If it is
                 pouring very slowly, just swirl it around with a spoon and press gently against 
                 the sieve and it will filter out a lot faster.
            </li>
            <h3>TO MAKE THE LEMONADE</h3>
            <li>
                To a very large pitcher, add the lemon juice and water along with all the
                 strawberry juice and 1 cup of the simple syrup. Taste it. If you want it more 
                 sweet, add the rest of the simple syrup. If you want a less strong taste, dilute 
                 it with a little bit of water. I did not add any extra water and used all the syrup 
                 and the taste was perfect for me.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Place in the fridge to chill or serve in a glass with ice immediately and enjoy!
