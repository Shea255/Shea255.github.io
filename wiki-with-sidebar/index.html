                    Color (or colour in Commonwealth English; see spelling differences) 
                    is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. 
                    Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related 
                    to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra, and interference. For most humans, colors are perceived 
                    in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). Other animals may have a different number
                     of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelengths, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and 
                     thus have a different color sensitivity range. Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or 
                     spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.

                    Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation)
                    , and luminance. Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light)
                     or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the 
                     right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength
                      light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being
                       abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a 
                       corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for
                        color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors, and television. Some of 
                        the most well-known color models and color
                     spaces are RGB, CMYK, HSL/HSV, CIE Lab, and YCbCr/YUV.!

                    Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life,
                     different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. 
                     Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes
                      overlapping areas. In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors
                       in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. The theory of color includes the 
                       color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally 
                       red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple), and t
                       ertiary colors.
                     The study of colors in general is called color science.

                    Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. 
                    When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths 
                    humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as "visible light"
                 </p>

                    Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving 
                    its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction 
                    determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than
                    color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same
                     color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent 
                     among individuals within the same species. In each such class, the members are called metamers of the color 
                     in question. This effect
                     can be visualized by comparing the light sources' spectral power distributions and the resulting colors.

                <h3 id="2">Spectral colors</h3>
                <p>
                    The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum—named using the Latin word for 
                    appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671—include all those colors that can be 
                    produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. 
                    The spectrum above shows approximate wavelengths (in nm) for spectral colors in the visible range. 
                    Spectral colors have 100% purity, and are fully saturated. A complex mixture of spectral colors can
                     be used to describe any 
                    color, which is the definition of a light power spectrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors 
                    linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency.[2] Despite the ubiquitous
                     ROYGBIV mnemonic used to remember the spectral colors in English, the inclusion or exclusion o
                      colors is contentious, with disagreement often focused on indigo and cyan.[3]
                     Even if the subset of color terms is agreed, their wavelength ranges and borders between them may not be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter 
                    its perception considerably. For example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity
                     yellow-green is olive green. Additionally, hue shifts towards yellow or blue happen if the intensity
                      of a spectral light is increased; this is called Bezold–Brücke shift. In color models capable of 
                      representing spectral colors,[4] such as CIELUV, a spectral color
                     has the maximal saturation. In Helmholtz coordinates, this is described as 100% purity.

                <h3 id="3">Color of objects</h3>
                <p>
                    The physical color of an object depends on how it absorbs and scatters light. Most objects scatter light to some
                     degree and do not reflect or transmit light specularly like glasses or mirrors.
                     A transparent object allows almost all light to transmit or pass through, thus transparent objects are perceived 
                     as colorless. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead absorbs 
                    or reflects the light it receives. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit
                     through, but translucent objects are seen colored because they scatter or absorb certain wavelengths of 
                     light via internal scattering. The absorbed light is often dissipated as heat.[5]

                <h3 id="5"> Development of theories of color vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Although Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and 
                    color vision, it was not until Newton that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. 
                    In 1810, Goethe published his comprehensive Theory of Colors in which he provided a rational 
                    description of color experience, which 'tells us how it originates, not what it is'. (Schopenhauer)

                    n 1801 Thomas Young proposed his trichromatic theory, based on the observation that any color 
                    could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by James Clerk Maxwell
                     and Hermann von Helmholtz. As Helmholtz puts it, "the principles of Newton's law of mixture were
                      experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that 
                      this marvelous investigator achieved in advance 
                    of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it."[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald Hering developed the opponent process theory of color,
                     noting that color blindness and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, 
                     ellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and 
                     Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, 
                    while processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus corresponds to the opponent theory.[7]

                <h3 id="6">Color in the eye</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of 
                    different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths. Humans are trichromatic—the 
                    retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct 
                    from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with 
                    wavelengths around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called short-wavelength cones or S 
                    cones (or misleadingly, blue cones). The other two types are closely related genetically and 
                    chemically: middle-wavelength cones, M cones, or green cones are most sensitive to light perceived 
                    as green, with wavelengths around 540 nm, while the long-wavelength cones, L cones, or red cones, 
                    are most sensitive to light that is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 nm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color
                     components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle of univariance, which is 
                     that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. 
                     For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the 
                     extent to which each is stimulated. 
                    These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called tristimulus values.[8]
